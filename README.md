Here I develop a game that helps hockey players get better at club technique. Hockey players will have an android app in their mobile phone. In the app, players will be able to choose different playing times and see how many goals were scored and how fast the player was during the selected time.

To detect hockey puck at very fast speed and that the sensor should work outdoors under sunlight, the infrared (iR) sensor, transmitter and receiver are chosen. They work by having an emitter side that sends out a beam of human-invisible IR light, then a receiver across the way which is sensitive to that same light. The nRF52832 microcontroller is used and data is sent to the android app via bluetooth.
